One of my favorite things is building small games for my family to play. This one turned out really fun!

The object of the game is to remove as many squares as possible before the time runs out. There are 12 levels to complete. To remove a square you click or tap any group of 2 or more squares. If you are stuck try using the "moves" at the bottom to rotate or scramble the board.

This game was built with React. I used CSS transitions and animations to make sure the game runs performantly on mobile hardware. Local storage is used for keeping track of high scores and saving paused game state. Hosted on GitHub Pages with CloudFlare providing SSL.
