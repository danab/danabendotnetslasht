I was curious about how to create a Slack Bot, so I decided to make a simple bot that would tell you the scores of current baseball games. One thing lead to another and now you can either view all the scores for a given day, or get an individual line score for a single game.

This bot uses serverless functions to query the MLBs unofficial API. The serverless functions respond with Slack specific mark up to render the information.
