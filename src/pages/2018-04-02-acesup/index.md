This simple card game was built for my grandmother for Christmas 2016. Playing cards are dealt onto four piles, and the goal is to end up with the only the four aces remaining.

This game was built with React and Redux. Local storage is used for keeping track of all time statistics and for saving paused game state. Hosted on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk.
